git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin "https://github.com/anatmart/repo_name.git"
git push -u origin main

1- Either you forgot to include the .gitignore file.

Here are all the steps required:

Create an empty Git repository on remote,

On local create the .gitignore file for your project. GitHub gives you a list of examples here

Launch a terminal, and in your project do the following commands:

git remote add origin YOUR/ORIGIN.git

git add .

git commit -m "initial commit or whatever message for first commit"

git push -u origin master
2- Or you are trying to create a new Github project.

Github replaced master with main as the default branch name. To resolve the issue :

On your local project:
remove the .git folder if it exists
recreate a clean repository by launching the following in your project:
in the terminal:

git init

git add .

git commit -m "YOUR FIRST MESSAGE HERE"

git branch -M main

git remote add origin _GIT_LINK_TO_PROJECT_HERE_

git push -u origin main
